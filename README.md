# Sai Bot 

## Hey there

> Sai bot is a Discord bot owned and hosted by user jlc#8474. It has many moderation, administration, utility, information, and fun features, however the largest feature of this bot are the features pertaining to Naruto, the animated TV series which this bot was inspired by. This includes a large database of characters from which detailed or general information can be fetched from the bot.

### Usage of the Code

> I am making this repository public so that my code is viewable to the public, to hopefully help in understanding the bot more, and hopefully this is not used for malicious purposes. I hope that anyone does not clone the bot without modification, however if you are willing to implement more features or collaborate with me in the bot's development, I would be more than happy to work with anyone, and host these modifications!
